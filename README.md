# Dotfiles 

## Usage 

Just copy them into your "home" directory.

If <i> .vim-tmp </i> is not appearing in 
<i> home </i>, it has to be 
created manually, and also to create empty 
directory named "swap" in ".vim-tmp".

In Safari, go to `Preferences`, `Advanced`, `Style sheet`, and 
select `safari.css` file.
